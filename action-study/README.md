# action-study

Toy problems for action-based or reinforcement-style numerical experimentation.

Subfolders:
- `burger/`: Burgers’ equation examples.
- `euler/`: Euler equations setups.
- `linear-advection/`: linear advection tests.

Use these as lightweight environments for experimenting with control/learning or solver prototyping.***
